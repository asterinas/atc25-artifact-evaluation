# Soundness evaluation

Asterinas introduce KernMiri to evaluate the soundness of the TCB. To run KernMiri:

```shell
./run_kernmiri.sh
```

**Note:** KernMiri uses an independent development branch of Asterinas, which is not synchronized with the main branch (the version used for performance and TCB evaluation).
